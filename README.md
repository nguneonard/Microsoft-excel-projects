# 1. Hands on guided project_ create a personal spending budget
We are going to use formulas to develop a spending budget for a client, David. As a business intelligence professional, you often use data analytic skills to review a company's financial. Today, we will review a client's financials to help them create a spending budget. Our goal will be to develop a spending budget to help David
make informed decisions about his spending. David has collected the necessary data to create a budget. We will use this data to make informed decisions about his spending. David wants to make sure he's spending his money responsibly. He feels like he might be overspending, but he's not sure. Your role for this project is to help him develop a spending budget to help him identify where exactly his money is being spent and how much money he should set aside for each spending category in the future. David has provided us data about several categories of expenses, including rent, utilities, from internet, food and entertainment. He has been collecting this data for the last four months. Let's use this data to figure out three things:
- where is the total amount David spends each month? 
- How much does he spend on average in each category? 
- And what percentage of his total spending is spent in each of these categories.
The figure below shows his spending habit.
